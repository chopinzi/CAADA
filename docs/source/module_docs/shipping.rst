Shipping package API
====================

This package focuses on retrieving data about import and export activity at major US ports. Currently, it supports
retrieving data for the Port of LA and Port of Oakland. Unlike many of the other packages, this is mainly centered
around web scraping to gather data for these ports, rather than reading local files. These functions are found in the
web_ module.
